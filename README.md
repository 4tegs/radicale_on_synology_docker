# radicale_on_synology_docker
Install and run radicale in Synology using a Docker container.

## What is radicicale?
Radicale is a very lightweight but powerful CalDAV (calendars, to-do lists) and CardDAV (contacts) server you can host yourself.

Here's the official homepage: <a href="https://radicale.org/" title="radicale.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://radicale.org</a>

## Purpose of this Github repository
* define the prereqisites
* setting up your environment in your Synology
* explain how to build your own docker container
* explain how to use the docker container
* run radicale

## Prerequisites

* A Synology NAS of the <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus" title="Synology Plus Series" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Plus Series</a>, as those are enabled for virtualizing environments with their more powerful central processing units (CPUs). These are easily identified by the name DSxxxx+.
* Some understanding of DNS, Network, Ports and Proxies to make sense of and secure things.
* Understanding of IP handling and Port forwarding for your Router.
* Understanding of the Synology Disk Station (DS) and the Disk Station Manager (DSM).
* Having Administrator Account access for DSM.
* A registered Domain which forwards (e.g. via DynDNS) to your Router/Server (Synology DS) and/or a Subdomain with according CNAME entry.
* On your Synology Docker is installed and running.
* SSH can be enabled and you know how to operate on command line with rrot access.

## Setting up the development area

To start, one needs a development area on the Synology. It is used to keep all needed files together that are needed to ramp up a Docker Image and in further steps the container and its necessary configuration files. This step is needed, regardless if you want to build your own image or if you simply publish the container.

* Use Synologyâ€™s desktop: **Control Panel-> Shared Folder-> Create**<br/>
* For later examples I called mine **dock_dev**.<br/>
* In dock_dev you create a folder called **radicale**.<br/>
* So the full path should sound **/volume1/dock_dev/radicale**<br/>
* copy the files provided by this repository to the new development folder on your Synology.
* Make sure you are able to SSH into your Synology. I will not explain how to do that. If you need help, ask Google.

The next step depends on what you want to achieve. If you simply want to use the given DockerHub Image and deploy your container skip the next steps and [move to Deploy the Docker Container](#deploy)
